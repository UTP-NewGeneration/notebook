Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $d = gcd(a, b)$. The equation $ax + by = c$ has infinitely many integral solutions if $d \mid c$ is true.

Let $k = \frac{c}{d}$ and $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ the solution found with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, then:

$$ x = k x_{1} + \lambda (\frac{b}{d}); y = k y_{1} - \lambda (\frac{a}{d}) $$
